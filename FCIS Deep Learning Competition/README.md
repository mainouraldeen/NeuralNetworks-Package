# FCIS Deep Learning Competition
Introduction
Welcome to the competition. This competition is for SC Students in Neural Networks course at FCIS. The goal of the competition is to build deep learning models that can distinguish between indoor scenes. This dataset contains great training and testing sets for forming models that can distinguish the scenes.

Content
This dataset contains 3,910 images of 10 classes of Indoor scenes. The data is split into 3,138 training images and 772 testing images, where each class has been split roughly in a 80-20 split.
