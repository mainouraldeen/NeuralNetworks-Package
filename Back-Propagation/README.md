# Back-Propagation Algorithm on Multi Layer Neural Networks
Task 3 using Iris Data, Tkinter, sklearn, pandas.

which can be able to classify a stream of input data to one of a set of predefined classes.
Use the iris data in both your training and testing processes. 
(Each class has 50 samples: train NN with the first 30 non-repeated samples, and test it with the remaining 20 samples)
